Financio – Scenario-Based Financial Literacy Web App

Financio is a web-based financial literacy platform that teaches real-world money management through interactive, scenario-driven learning. Instead of reading static content, users actively engage in realistic financial situations where they must listen, think, and respond correctly to progress.

The goal of Financio is to make financial education practical, engaging, and accessible for beginners by simulating everyday decisions related to spending, saving, and budgeting.

What Makes Financio Different

Traditional finance learning is passive. Financio turns learning into an experience.

Users are placed inside guided financial scenarios delivered through short videos and narrated questions. They respond using voice input, receive instant feedback, and can only move forward once the correct financial decision is made. This ensures true understanding rather than guesswork.
